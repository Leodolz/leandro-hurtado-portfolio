                    <p>
                        This park was not maintained in the past. It had no usage from the townsfolk and had very
                        seldom trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This park had no walkways as its grass was very tall and not being cut as there was no
                        investment from the city.

                    <p>
                        This park is commonly browsed by people all day along and is popular for photo-shooting for
                        different kinds of events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is also very common to be visited by people with their pets, usually dogs

                    <p>
                        This plaza was an abandoned park which was usually avoided by people nearby as it had almost
                        no security and it had no investment from the major's office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Its characteristic fountain did not work and it contained a kiosk for buying snacks. This place
                        was mostly surrounded by houses and some buildings.

                    <p>
                        This plaza has been renewed and now had better fountains and contains better security to ensure
                        a safe walk for people nearby at all hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This place is usually more crowded on the evenings.

                        This plaza is where the first protests against colonies were done and where the dream of a
                        republic started.

                    <p>

                        This plaza is used by people living nearby for taking a stroll and the government usually

                        This is the stadium before its restoring work, this picture shows how it was already in need

                    <p>
                        This stadium is very crowded when the local team 'Wilsterman' plays, as people from Cochabamba
                        are usually rooting for this team.

                    <p>
                        This place is built for a diverse set of olympic disciplines and is regularly used by

                    <p>
                        This lake used to cover a bigger area and had clearer waters. With urbanization that made
                        progress each year, came a harder way to maintain this lake which can get big areas dried
                        out during summer.

                        This lake is a place with a nice view and is surrounded by both a walkway and a bike way as
                        it has a big radius, many people use it for doing exercise while having a good view.

                        On its surroundings there is a construction covering a big area that is used for hosting the
                        annual fair which lasts 10 days and is mostly crowded on the nights. This construction is also
                        used for hosting big events such as concerts and big parties.

                    <p>
                        This place was even more crowded in the past as it was one of a handful of plazas for doing
                        different activities.

                    <p>
                        Protests and gatherings were usually done here as this place was still doing activities for

                        located in the center of the city, it is a place where townsfolk can go pay for their taxes and
                        do other administrative activities regarding taxes.
