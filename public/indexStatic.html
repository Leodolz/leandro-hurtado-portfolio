        <p> <!-- Paragraph with a summary about myself -->
            I am a software developer residing in Bolivia who is currently studying an MS degree in Software Development
            online at Boston University. My experience in developing applications for a diverse set of environments is
            of 3 years having contributed in different companies in a diverse set of roles. I am always eager to learn
            something new every day and to always interact with different people for having a broader mindset with
            every interaction. I was able to grow in my career starting from being a mentee to being a mentor over time,
            always trying to equip myself with the necessary tools and knowledge and to give back and share my learnings
            to other people.
        </p>
        <p> <!-- Another paragraph summarizing about me -->
            Since I got graduated from a BS in Electronics and Telecommunications, I noticed that my true passion is
            within programming, because this is a field where uniqueness and imagination is a talent and I feel at
            best when I am given the freedom on designing and implementing how to tackle an issue and deliver a
            solution that adapts to the company's needs and adjusts to its mission. My passion has done nothing more
            than growing in this field, making me curious in the different branches of software development and
            programming in general can offer, such fields as frontend programming, backend programming, database design,
            application deployment, data science, etc. I like to challenge myself into learning from each field and
            branch for making me as skillful as possible for being able to reach a higher impact in wherever I decide
            to contribute with my work.
