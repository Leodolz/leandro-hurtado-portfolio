        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Below I talk about some of my favorite hobbies and passions I have in my personal life
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Video-games</h3>
                <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/945095205892695583/2F59D5D59B02311A8BEC150F723A96CB20D502AC/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false"
                     alt="Gif of a TV displaying video-game in starting screen"
                />
                <p>
                    This would be my N#1 hobby as I grew up with video-games and its
                    every day interaction with this hobby, determined my personality as time went by, having played
                    with pretty much every console that went to my hands and having single-player video-games as
                    my favorite category of video-games, I have gone through every genre it could offer me and I
                    feel at ease in any kind of video-game I play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The time I dedicate to this hobby has changed
                    throughout the different stages of my life, but I always play some at least on some nights
                    of the week or some mornings on the weekends.

                <h3>Arts appreciation</h3>

                     alt="Image of a person appreciating paintings in a museum"
                />
                <p>
                    This may be a broad scope, but I really enjoy everything
                    that involves art, either painting, music, movies, musicals, etc. Everything that involves
                    expressing feelings, situations and mindsets through these different channels, I really enjoy
                    that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hobby has grown stronger over the last years as I have matured and can absorb better
                    on what the artist wants to communicate, and I already play a musical instrument to feel even
                    more connected with different artists, especially musical artists.

                <h3>Traveling</h3>

                />
                <p>
                    Although this is not something you could do every day or even once
                    a week, I find traveling a big passion whereas I want to dedicate as much time as I can while
                    working, studying or focusing in other goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travelling has been a common practice in my family
                    and has helped me create strong bonds with them, always having the curiosity and passion to see
                    new places and learn from new mindsets. I am amazed with every travel I make, even if it is a local
                    visit to a town nearby, I always find it enriching to my life and my mindset.

                <h3>Ping-pong</h3>
                <img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/2934379/screenshots/6283226/tennis_2.gif"
                     alt="Gif of a ping-pong video-game"
                />
                <p>
                    I have started playing ping-pong since my dad purchased a table in
                    my house, and played several times a day with my sister.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hobby grew when I was at college
                    and made friends with some ping-pong players, I used to play every day after classes. Now I
                    don't usually play, but from time to time I invite my friends to my home for some matches
